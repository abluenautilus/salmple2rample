# Salmple2Rample
## Converts sound banks arranged in a Squid Salmple format to the arrangement needed for Squarp Rample

Soundforce Samples 2 uses pretty much the same format as Rample so it will work for that module as well. You can specify 4 or 5 (or more) channels to be retained from the original Squid Salmple's 8 channels. 

Syntax: 

`salmple2sample.py <full path to Squid format sound bank> <output folder> <number of channels to keep>`
